- Lingo for the upcoming session, let's get comfortable with the subject. Inclusive and mindful way to speak about the accessibility.
	- **Person-first language:** Emphasize the person, not the disability. For example, "person with a disability" instead of "disabled person."
	- **Positive language:** Use words that convey empowerment and respect. Avoid terms like "confined to a wheelchair" or "suffering from a disability." 
	  **_Instead_**:
	  "uses a wheelchair"
	  "lives with a disability"
	  "person with a disability"
	  "person with a physical challenge"
	- **Disability:** A broad term that encompasses a wide range of impairments.
	- **Accessibility:** The design and implementation of products, services, and environments that are usable by everyone, regardless of their abilities.
	- **Assistive technology:** Devices, systems, or equipment that help people with disabilities to access information and perform tasks.
	- **Universal design:** A design approach that considers the needs of everyone, including people with disabilities.
	- **It's not a topic to learn** it is a life-long journey - **Be open to learn**
